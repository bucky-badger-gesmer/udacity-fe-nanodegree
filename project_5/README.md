# Restaurant Review App

## Instructions
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` to start the app, and visit `http://localhost:8000` in a browser window. 

All code written in this project is written by me. It did not require any third-party libraries, and only utilized pre-existing template code.
