# Project 2 Memory Game

## About
Open `index.html` to begin playing the memory game. Match all cards as fast as you can without making mistakes! A perfect score of 3 stars is achieved with 10 moves or less. If you complete the game in 16 moves or less, you will score 2 stars. Anything above 16 moves is a score of 1 star.

## Dependencies
All code written in this project is written by me. It did not require any third-party libraries, and only utilized pre-existing template code.
