# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

## About
This is a game based off of the famous "Frogger" arcade game! Move the character across the board without being hit by an enemy character!

All code written in this project is written by me. It did not require any third-party libraries, and only utilized pre-existing template code.

## Instructions
Open `index.html` to begin playing "Frogger" arcade game! Using only the arrow keys `↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`, move the character from the bottom of the screen to the top, without hitting any enemy characters! If you hit an enemy, you lose the game, and will be asked to play again. If you get across successfully, you win (and will be asked to play again)! Have fun!
